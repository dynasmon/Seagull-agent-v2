Seagull Agent v2 is the endpoint component of Seagull v2: the process that runs
on a host, observes it, and delivers what it observed durably to the
[Seagull backend](https://github.com/dynasmon/Seagull-backend-v2).

It is built, tested and released from this repository alone. The only Seagull
code it consumes is the published
[contracts](https://github.com/dynasmon/Seagull-contracts) module, at the release
`go.mod` pins. Nothing from the backend, the frontend or the
[legacy agent](https://github.com/dynasmon/seagull-agent) is imported, replaced
or checked out beside it; the legacy agent is a record of behavior and edge
cases, not a template.

## Build and test

The go command selects the toolchain `go.mod` names and fetches every dependency
from the module proxy, so a checkout of this repository is all a build needs.

```bash
make build      # dist/seagull-agent
make verify     # formatting, vet, module graph, tests, race detector and build
make vulncheck  # known vulnerabilities reachable from the agent
```

`seagull-agent -version` prints the build identity: the version Go stamps from
this repository's history, the toolchain and the platform. It is metadata about
a build, not proof of which build is running.

## Boundaries

`tests/architecture` holds the repository boundaries as tests rather than as
conventions:

- no source file, whatever its build constraints, imports another Seagull
  repository except the contracts;
- the contracts are required at a published release, and no module is replaced;
- no submodule or committed workspace brings a sibling checkout into the build;
- ignore rules never hide a source file or a test fixture, and the local skills
  never reach Git.

`tests/compatibility` reads the ingest messages from bytes written against the
wire format rather than with the generated types, so a contracts release that
renumbers or retypes a field the agent depends on fails the suite instead of
changing what the agent reads.

## Working against a local contracts checkout

While a contract change is in progress, a `go.work` beside `go.mod` may `use` a
sibling checkout of the contracts. Git ignores it, and every `make` target runs
with `GOWORK=off`, so the gates always verify the published release `go.mod`
pins rather than the sibling.
